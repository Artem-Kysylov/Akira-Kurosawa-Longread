                                    <p class="about__story-content-text">Akira Kurosawa was born in Japan in 1910. From an early age the young Kurosawa lived an eventful life – his father encouraging him to pursue painting, calligraphy, kendo and an interest in films. Kurosawa’s older brother, Heigo, was also a big influence on the young AK, nurturing a love of literature, and also encouraging him to see as many new movies as possible. But it wasn’t until Kurosawa turned 26 – after the death of his older brother – that he was to enter the movie world in earnest 	after being recruited by Japanese movie studio PCL (later to become Toho) on the back of a newspaper advert.</p>
                                    <p class="about__story-content-text">From that moment on his life was to change. Throughout his life Kurosawa was to make more than thirty films as a director, and contributed to many more – writing scripts and working as an Assistant Director. Film became his life and his work was to prove extremely influential throughout the 20th Century. From his directorial debut, Sanshiro Sugata, in 1943.</p>

                                <p class="about__numbers-text">Kurosawa continued to explore complex and delicate humanistic themes, gradually building a reputation as a film-maker unwilling to compromise either his vision or his message, and throughout the 1950s and 60s this was further cemented with the addition of many films that are now considered classics of world cinema. </p>
                                <p class="about__numbers-text">Despite studio interference, continued unfair criticism by some quarters of the Japanese media, the ‘failure’ of his first colour film Dodes’Kaden in 1970, and a subsequent suicide attempt, Kurosawa continued to make films for an appreciative world-wide audience throughout the remainder of the 20th Century, though due to a reluctance on the part of the Japanese film industry to fund his pictures, less frequently than many would maybe have liked.</p>
                                <p class="about__numbers-text">Kurosawa's film-making career went on well into his eighties, until his death in 1998. His last few films are considered more minor, more personal works than the epics made previously, though these – without doubt – have great appeal for those appreciative of his work. And Kurosawa’s work continues to live on, after his passing.</p>

                            <p class="works__content-text">After seven years of working as an assistant director, Kurosawa first got the opportunity to participate in the creation of a film more thoroughly - for the film "The Genius of Judo", he wrote the script himself. The film was about the development of judo in Japan at the end of the 19th century.</p>
                            <p class="works__content-text">Ten more films followed, including The Most Beautiful, Judo Genius II, and Drunken Angel . This was Kurosawa's first collaboration with young actor Toshiro Mifune. It was with this film that the long-term cooperation between the director and the actor began, so Mifune starred in many films by Akira Kurosawa.</p>

                                        <p class="golden__films__item-content-text">Kurosawa gained international fame and recognition after the release of the 1950 film Rashomon (starring Toshiro Mifune and Shimura Takashi), based on the stories of the classic of new Japanese literature Ryunosuke Akutagawa "Rashomon Gate" and "In more often", filmed in the genre of "jidaigeki" (films about the warriors of feudal Japan - samurai). Critical reviews around the world were more than benevolent.</p>
                                        <p class="golden__films__item-content-text">Kurosawa's appearance on the international screen was heralded by the film's triumph at the Venice Film Festival, where the film was awarded the Golden Lion Grand Prize (the first non-European film ever to win this prize) and a special Oscar at the 1952 ceremony for best foreign film of the year. This film, carefully planned and filled with philosophical meaning, takes the viewer both into the past and into the future, tells about the violence and murder in feudal Japan from four completely different points of view.</p>

                                        <p class="golden__films__item-content-text">In 1951, Kurosawa made a second film for the Japanese film studio Shochiku (the first was Scandal). The film was the Japanese film adaptation of Fyodor Dostoyevsky's novel The Idiot of the same name. The original cut of the film was to be in two parts and run for 265 minutes of screen time. The film was filmed entirely in the studio (in connection with the director's wishes). But after filming, the studio felt the film was too long and forced the director to recut and cut the film down to 166 minutes.</p>
                                        <p class="golden__films__item-content-text">Akira Kurosawa later spoke about the film:</p>
                                        <p class="golden__films__item-content-text">“Of all the films I've made, this is the one I get most often written about... ...I wanted to make The Idiot long before Rashomon. From an early age I fell in love with Russian literature, but I realized that Dostoevsky is the best, and I thought for a long time about what could be made into a wonderful film from this book. Dostoevsky is still my favorite writer, and he is the only one - in my opinion - who wrote truthfully about human existence.”</p>

                                            <p class="golden__films__item-content-text">While "Rashomon" was imbued with a sense of Eastern mysticism, the next international hit - "Seven Samurai" (1954) testified to the filmmaker's fascination with Western society and its culture. In fact, one of Kurosawa's great achievements in the 1950s was to develop a style of filmmaking that transcended the use of Eastern and Western cultural traditions and combined elements of high and popular culture. In particular, Western literature became a source of inspiration for him.</p>
                                            <p class="golden__films__item-content-text">The film appeared largely because Akira Kurosawa really wanted to try his hand at the jidaigeki genre, popular in Japan, and make it both deep in meaning and fascinating in form. Initially, he wanted to make a film-parable about one day in the life of a samurai, to trace all the actions of the hero until the evening when the hero was supposed to commit ritual suicide.</p>

                                        <p class="golden__films__item-content-text films__item-content-text-full">As a result, Kurosawa did not dare to take on such material, believing that he did not know the necessary nuances well enough. However, in the course of working on this plot, he came across a case when a village belonging to one of the murdered feudal lords hired several ronin to protect themselves from robbers, and decided to base the film on this particular story. In preparation for filming, Kurosawa wrote detailed biographies and descriptions of each significant character in the film—what clothes he wears, how he talks, what kind of food he prefers, and so on.</p>

                                        <p class="golden__films__item-content-text">In 1960, one of Kurosawa's most socially poignant films, The Bad Sleep in Peace, was released. The main role of a young man who avenges the death of his father is played by Toshiro Mifune. A young man, Koichi Nishi, seeks revenge for the death of his father, who was forced to commit suicide by the vice president of a large land company. In order to imprison accomplices in crime, Nishi uses other people's documents (Nishi is his fake name), is hired as a secretary in the same company, enters into the confidence of the vice president Iwabuchi and Iwabuchi's son, even marries his daughter Yoshiko.</p>
                                        <p class="golden__films__item-content-text">The plot of the film is vaguely reminiscent of Shakespeare's Hamlet. However, Victor Raspopin writes that if the film refers to Hamlet, then “it’s more like turning Shakespeare’s problems inside out, because Hamlet’s strength is in his weakness, and Nisi’s strength is in anger, until he runs out of it”</p>

In a small town, two bandit clans are terrorizing the locals. A vagabond samurai (ronin), who introduces himself as Kuwabatake Sanjuro (the role is played by Toshiro Mifune), with the help of a sword, cunning and intrigue, pushes both gangs together and thus forces them to destroy each other. He kills the surviving and triumphant members of one of the gangs. Calm in the town is restored, and the samurai leaves it. The plot of the film is an adaptation of two detective novels by Dashiell Hammett: The Glass Key (1931; there is a film adaptation of the same name) and Blood Harvest (1929).</p>

K. Arsenyev. The director's first non-Japanese-language film, and at the same time the only one shot by him on 70mm wide-format film.</p>
                                        <p class="dersu-uzala__films__item-content-text">The plot of the film is based on the books "In the Ussuri region" and "Dersu Uzala" by the scientist and writer, famous traveler and explorer of the Far East Vladimir Arsenyev, and tells about his travels in the Ussuri region and friendship with the taiga hunter Dersu Uzala, whose extraordinary personal qualities delighted Arsenyev.</p>

                                        <p class="last__films__item-content-text">The plot of the film is based on the biography of the Japanese professor, academician and writer Hyakken Uchida (1889-1971). At the beginning of the film, the German professor decides to leave teaching in order to focus entirely on literature, as his books have begun to generate income. As he himself admits, he likes to teach, but "if you chase two hares, you won't catch one." This takes place shortly before the outbreak of World War II. The main theme of the film is his relationship with former students, who continue to care for him, considering him "pure gold - a real professor." </p>

                                    <p class="last__films__item-content-text films__item-content-text-full">The professor suffers a series of failures, from which only his former students help him get out. What's more, they organize an annual "Not yet" celebration dedicated to the professor's birthday. The name of the holiday means that the professor is still alive and not ready to go to another world, and contains an allusion to the game of hide and seek.</p>
